My assigned search engine was duckduckgo but I faced issues with receiving results for all 100 queries so I switched to bing. The average percent overlap between Bing and Google is 14.50%, indicating a modest similarity between the two search engines in terms of shared results. However, the average Spearman coefficient is -9.13, which deviates significantly from the typical -1 to 1 range for Spearman's rho. The results demonstrate that while there is some overlap in search results, the ranking orders of those overlapping URLs tend to differ considerably, leading to an overall negative correlation. Bing's performance, based on these metrics, can be considered worse than Google's. The low overlap indicates that Bing and Google return quite different results, and the strongly negative Spearman coefficient shows that Bing does not rank the overlapping results in a similar manner to Google.
