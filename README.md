# webSearchEngineComparison
compares results of different search enegines

## Overview
This project analyzes and compares various web search engines based on key factors such as **indexing efficiency, ranking algorithms, crawling strategies, retrieval speed, and privacy policies**. The comparison includes search engines like **Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Brave**, highlighting their strengths, trade-offs, and unique features.

## Features
- **Indexing & Crawling**: Evaluates how efficiently search engines index and update content.
- **Ranking Algorithms**: Analyzes how search engines rank results based on relevance and quality.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Compares how different engines handle user data and tracking.
- **Performance & Speed**: Measures search response time and result freshness.
- **Spam & Duplicate Content Handling**: Reviews how engines filter low-quality or duplicate results.
